Hello! This is my app 'Calurry' which is a calorie tracking app that specifically includes Indian vegetarian food as there are not many apps available that encompass this market. The app was coded in flutter/dart and will only be available here on Github as publishing the app to Apple App Store and Google Play Store is a bit expensive. There may be an updated food list in the future that will integrate an SQL database, but for now, it is complete.
